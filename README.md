# Amizone-Faculty-Feedback-Form-Script
A script to automate the boring feedback form from Amizone.

Follow the steps to get the job done.

* Log into your Amizone account
* Select the MyFaculty option from the left side
* Choose any faculty you would like to give feedback to
* Press ctrl + shift + I in windows or cmd + option + i in a mac to open the console in your browser
* Paste the code from the script.js file into the console
* Choose the rating you want to give your Faculty
* OPTIONAL : To change the end review, edit the first line of the Script
let feedback = "";
* NOTE : Only change the text within the double quotes. If you change anything else, the script will not work.
* Wait for the script to do its magic.
* Repeat for every faculty.

If the script is not working as expected, please open an issue from the issues tab and I will fix it ASAP.
